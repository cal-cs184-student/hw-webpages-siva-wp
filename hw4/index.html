		<h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
		<ol>

			<li>

				<ul>

					<li>
						Below are some simulation images with a few different spring constants (on <code>scene/pinned2.json</code>, and all other parameters are the default ones). What we notice is that the higher the spring constant, the less that the cloth drapes in the final rest position (which makes sense, because a higher spring constant means that points are prevented from stretching far away from each other). On the contrary, the cloth ends up having many more and thinner folds in the rest position with a smaller spring constant, which makes sense because there is a weaker force keeping the point masses on the flaps together, thus reducing the size of each flap, and allowing the cloth to sag more in the rest position.
						<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
							<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">

								</td>
							</tr>
							</table>
						</div>
					</li>

					<li>
						Below are some simulation images with a few different densities (on <code>scene/pinned2.json</code>, and all other parameters are the default ones). What we notice is that the lower the density of the mesh, the less that the cloth drapes (which makes sense because a lower density means that the force of gravity has a lower effect on each individual point mass, which prevents the cloth from having a considerable "U"-shape from opposing the spring force). Additionally, the flaps are more pronounced with a higher density, because the springs are more active in preventing the cloth from folding against the force of gravity.

					<li>
						Below are some simulation images with a few different damping percentages at approximately the same time of simulation (on <code>scene/pinned2.json</code>, and all other parameters are the default ones). It appears that the resting state doesn't change with different damping values, but the convergence to the steady-state configuration of the mesh is different based on the damping. If the damping value is high, then it takes a very long time for the cloth to drape (since we essentially only have the point mass forces multiplied by the change in time squared to affect the position of each point mass). If the damping value is very low, the cloth falls down extremely quickly and oscillates heavily around the resting state, because we have no damping to reduce the rate of change in the position of each point mass.

		<h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
		<ol>

			<li>
				For spheres, I used the following collision process:
				<ul>

					<li>First, I check if \(\left\|\vec{p_m}-\vec{p_s}\right\|\leq r_s\) (where \(r_s\) is the radius of the sphere, \(\vec{p_m}\) is the position of the point mass, and \(\vec{p_s}\) is the position of the sphere's origin). If this is true, then we know there is a collision and the current position of the point mass is in the sphere. If not, then we just short-circuit the function and don't do anything else.</li>

					<li>Assuming there is a collision, we calculate the tangent vector \(\vec{t}=\vec{p_s}+r_s\cdot\frac{\vec{p_m}-\vec{p_s}}{\left\|\vec{p_m}-\vec{p_s}\right\|_2}\) (where \(\vec{p_s}\) is the origin of the sphere). We want to ensure that our point mass position never crosses the sphere boundary, so we calculate an adjustment \(\vec{a}=\vec{t}-\vec{l_m}\) (where \(\vec{l_m}\) is the last position of the point mass). We do this to find out where our point mass's position should be at to be above the surface of the sphere, but not clip into the sphere.</li>

					<li>We now set the position \(\vec{p_m}:=\vec{l_m}+(1-f)\vec{a}\) where \(f\) is the friction on the surface of the sphere. The reason for the friction is to allow the cloth to slide around the surface of the sphere if possible (so we don't pin the position of the point mass to the tangent position found on the sphere).</li>

				</ul>
				For planes, I used the following collision process:
				<ul>

					<li>First, I check if \(\text{dot}\left(\vec{p_m}-\vec{p},\vec{n}\right)\cdot\text{dot}\left(\vec{l_m}-\vec{p},\vec{n}\right)\lt 0\) (where \(\vec{p}\) is an arbitrary point on the plane and \(\vec{n}\) is the normal vector). If this is true, then it implies that our cloth crossed the plane during this timestep. Additionally, I checked if \(\text{dot}\left(\vec{p_m}-\vec{p}\right)\lt C\) (where \(C\) is the surface offset constant) to see if the point mass is close enough to the plane right now to try and push our point mass further from the plane. If either of these conditions hold, then I know that my plane collision happened and I proceed with the next steps. If both of these conditions don't pass, then I will declare that a collision/crossing did not happen (and short-circuit my function).</li>

					<li>I calculate the tangent point (offsetted by \(C\)) as follows:
						\[\vec{t}=\vec{p_m}-(a+c)\vec{n}\]
					where \(a=\text{dot}\left(\vec{p_m}-\vec{p},\vec{n}\right)\) (i.e. the perturbation that \(p_m\) needs to go through to hit the exact tangent point), and \(c\) is \(+C\) if \(a_l>0\) (where \(a_l=\text{dot}\left(\vec{l_m}-\vec{p},\vec{n}\right)\)), and \(-C\) otherwise. \(c\) accounts for the fact that our final position should not touch the plane, but rather be at minimum distance \(C\) from the plane on the side that the collision is coming from.
					</li>

					<li>We then simply define \(\vec{p_m}:=\vec{l_m}+\left(\vec{t}-\vec{p_m}\right)\left(1-f\right)\) to apply our plane boundary to the point mass (along with accounting-for friction).</li>

				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>Below are the resting positions of the cloth over <code>scene/sphere.json</code> with various spring constant parameters. What we notice is that a smaller spring constant results in more ripples in the cloth and more fine draping over the sphere (i.e. we can see the sphere shape more clearly around the top of the cloth). This is expected, because a lower spring constant allows for the cloth to drape over the sphere with very little resistance from the springs that would otherwise keep the cloth "flatter". For a large spring constant, we get that there are fewer ripples in the cloth, and our cloth does not mold to the sphere as much when placed over the sphere. This is also expected becuase a high spring constant forces the cloth to be more flat and create fewer small folds, regardless of the force from the sphere trying to have the cloth fully drape around the sphere.

		<h2>Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>
		<ol>

			<li>
			To handle self-collisions, we decide to test each point mass against points only in its close vicinity in order to reduce computation time. This is done by hashing each point mass to a position in a hash table, and we test each point mass to find its collisions with other point masses in the same hash position. I first had to pick a hash function to map the positions of point masses to float values such that point masses close to each other are in the same hash position. The way I organized this is that I split the space of all point masses into boxes in 3D space. Each box has width \(w=3\cdot\frac{W}{n_w}\), height \(h=3\cdot\frac{H}{n_h}\), and \(t=\max(w,h)\) (where \(W\) is the width of our cloth, \(H\) is the height of the cloth \(n_w\) is the number of point masses in each row of the cloth, and \(n_h\) is the number of point masses in each column of the cloth). The number \(3\) is a constant that ends-up being empirically efficient. I define the hash of a point \(\vec{p}\) to be:
				\[\text{hash}\left(\vec{p}\right)=\left\lfloor\frac{p_x}{w}\right\rfloor+\left\lfloor\frac{p_y}{h}\right\rfloor\cdot n_w+\left\lfloor\frac{p_z}{t}\right\rfloor\cdot n_w\cdot\max(n_w,n_h)\]
			So, any point in the same box will hash itself to the same position in our <code>map</code> in the <code>Cloth</code> class. This hash function choice is described in the <code>hash_position</code> function. Then, in the <code>build_spatial_map</code> function, I clear the map of point masses, and then for each point mass, I calculate its hash value and I add a pointer to the point mass in the corresponding hash table index (each position uses a <code>vector</code> to maintain the list of pointers). In each iteration of the simulation, I first build the spatial map (using <code>build_spatial_map</code>), and then I apply collisions using the <code>self_collide</code> function on each point mass. The <code>self_collide</code> function first calculates the distance between a point mass \(P\) and all of the other point masses in the same box as point mass \(P\). For every point mass \(P_i\) whose distance from \(P\) (\(d_{i}\)) is less than twice the thickness of the cloth, I add the adjustment vector \(\vec{a_i}\) that forces \(P\) to be of distance exactly twice the thickness from \(P_i\). The adjustment is calculated as follows:
				\[\vec{a_i}=\frac{\vec{p}_i-\vec{p}}{\left\|\vec{p}-\vec{p_i}\right\|_2}\cdot 2\cdot T-\vec{p}\]
			where \(\vec{p}_i\) is the position of point mass \(P_i\), \(\vec{p}\) is the position of our point mass \(P\), and \(T\) is the thickness of the mesh. Then, I take the average of the sum of all of these adjustments (and as a small optimization: divide by the number of steps in the simulation for this iteration). I then take this average and add it to the position of point mass \(P\). This process of hashing thus ensures that, approximately, no point on the mesh goes within a small enough distance to any other point mass in the mesh.

				Below are images of <code>scene/selfCollision.json</code> at steady-state with the spring constant varied and all other parameters being the default ones. The lower the spring constant, the more the wrinkles in the cloth and the more folds that happen when the cloth is colliding with itself. This makes sense because with a smaller spring constant, the cloth is more free to bend more finely, leading to the cloth colliding such that it has many small wrinkles. On the contrary, with a high spring constant, the cloth does not fold much, and its folds have a more distinctive curve to them. This is also expected, because a higher spring constant prevents the cloth from bending very sharply/creasing, thus giving fewer, but larger folds/bends in our cloth in steady-state. Additionally, the higher spring constant had less rippling/oscillation in steady-state compared to a lower spring constant (which is expected because a high spring constant means that the corrections made by the self collisions are less frequent/large relative to the spring forces).

				Below are images of <code>scene/selfCollision.json</code> at steady-state with the density varied and all other parameters being the default ones. A lower density results in fewer, but larger folds in the cloth in steady-state. This is expected because we have there being less of a gravitational force relative to the spring and self-collision forces. This leads to the cloth preventing fine creasing and small folds, thus leading to fewer, larger folds. On the contrary, the high density leads to more rippling/oscillation at steady-state and many more smaller folds in the cloth at steady-state. This is also expected, because the spring forces are less significant compared to the gravitational force, and there is more oscillation at steady state. An additional fact to note is that a higher density leads to the cloth falling to its final, crumpled state more quickly, as the spring forces are weaker relative to the gravitational force, thus leading to the cloth colliding with itself more.
