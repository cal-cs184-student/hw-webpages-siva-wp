		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.

		<h2>Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>We know that to generate our rendering, we need to take samples of each pixel in our current camera view. To do this, for each pixel \((x,y)\), we take the average of <code>ns_aa</code> independent radiance samples, where the \(i\)-th sample is at the position: \((x+X_i,y+Y_i)\), where \(X_i,Y_i\sim\text{Uniform}(0,1)\) (the Monte-Carlo estimate under a uniform distribution is just the average of the samples). Once we get the average, we assign the pixel on the screen to the average radiance. For each sample position, we utilize the <code>generate_ray</code> function to transform our sample position from our image space to our world space. This function does the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Find the direction from the camera position to the sample position using the formula:\[\vec{d}=\left(-\tan\left(\frac{\text{horizontal FOV}}{2}\right)+2x\times\tan\left(\frac{\text{horizontal FOV}}{2}\right),-\tan\left(\frac{\text{vertical FOV}}{2}\right)+2y\times\tan\left(\frac{\text{vertical FOV}}{2}\right),-1\right)\]</li>
				<li>Rotate the direction by the camera-to-world rotation matrix as follows:\[\vec{d}:=M_{\text{C2W}}\vec{d}\] This will tell us the direction of the sample point from the camera position in world space.</li>
				<li>Finally, normalize our direction vector: \(\vec{d}:=\frac{\vec{d}}{\|\vec{d}\|_2}\)</li>
				<li>Create a ray with the origin at the camera position (<code>pos</code>) and the direction as \(\vec{d}\). Additionally, specify the minimum and maximum intersection times of any ray coming out of the camera as the near-clipping plane and far-clipping plane, respectively.</li>
			</ul>
			Now, for each generated ray, <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code> goes through each primitive in our scene and checks if our ray intersects it at a valid position. There are two primitives we dealt with in this part:
			<ul>
				<li>Triangles: we declare an intersection if our ray intersects our triangle at a time \(t\in[\min_t,\max_t]\) (where \(\min_t\) and \(\max_t\) are values in our ray object). If we find an intersection, update the \(\max_t\) to the time of the intersection (we only care about the first intersection). The algorithm is described in the next question.</li>
				<li>Circles: we declare an intersection if our ray intersects our circle at a time \(t\in[\min_t,\max_t]\). If we find an intersection, update the \(\max_t\) to the time of the intersection. To find if an intersection happened, we apply the quadratic formula to solve the following:\[\left\|\vec{r_o}+t\cdot\vec{r_d}-\vec{s_o}\right\|_2^2=t^2\left\|\vec{r_d}\right\|_2^2+2t\vec{r_d}^\top\left(\vec{r_o}-\vec{s_o}\right)+\left\|\vec{r_o}-\vec{s_o}\right\|_2^2=s_r^2\]where \(r\) is our ray and \(s\) is our sphere. We pick the smallest valid intersection time \(t^\star\) if one exists, and declare that there was no intersection if no such \(t^\star\) exists. Our normal vector will be the normalization of the following vector: \[\vec{r_o}+t^\star\vec{r_d}-\vec{s_o}\]</li>
			</ul>
			In the case of an intersection, we record the normal at the point of the first intersection. <code>est_radiance_global_illumination</code> will use this normal to calculate our normal shading radiance, which we define as the radiance of our sample.
			</li>
			<li>For triangle intersection, we first pick the triangle normal \(\vec{n_i}\) to be the \(i\)-th normal to the plane of the triangle and \(\vec{p_i}\) as the \(i\)-th vertex of the triangle. First, we check if our ray is parallel to the triangle, in which case we don't have an intersection. Our ray is parallel iff \(\vec{n_1}^\top\vec{r_d}=0\) (i.e. the ray direction is orthogonal to the normal of the triangle plane). For a non-parallel ray, we are going to find the barycentric coordinates of the intersection point of our ray with the triangle's plane. We can do this by solving the following matrix formula:\[\begin{bmatrix}-\vec{r_d}&\vec{p_2}-\vec{p_1}&\vec{p_3}-\vec{p_1}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}t\\b_2\\b_3\end{bmatrix}=\vec{r_o}-\vec{p_1}\]where \(b_1=1-b_2-b_3\) and \(b_1\vec{p_1}+b_2\vec{p_2}+b_3\vec{p_3}=\vec{r_o}+t\vec{r_d}\). We know that the triangle intersection occurs if \(b_1\), \(b_2\), and \(b_3\) are all in the range \([0,1]\) (because then our intersection point is in our triangle). We also check to make sure that our intersection time is within the range \([\min_t,\max_t]\) for our ray, and update \(\max_t\) if the intersection occurs. For our interpolated normal vector (for normal shading), we define the normal vector at our intersection as \(b_1\vec{n_1}+b_2\vec{n_2}+b_3\vec{n_3}\).
			</li>
			<li>Here are some images that have been shaded with normal shading using my program:

		<h2>Part 2: Bounding Volume Hierarchy</h2>
		<ol>

			<li>

				At each node, I first created a list of centroids \(C\) of all the triangles from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> for my node. I also calculate the bounding box that contains all of the primitives. Firstly, if <code>end-start+1</code> is at most the max leaf size, then I turn this node into a leaf node and just return the created node. If not, then for the dimension \(d\) with the largest extent in our bounding box, I do the following:
				<ul>

					<li>I sort \(C\) by the dimension.</li>

					<li>I found the median (\(m\)) of the sorted list, and then found how many elements are \(\lt m\) and how many elements are \(\geq m\)</li>

					<li>The larger of these counts is defined as the "split size" of my split along this dimension.</li>
				
				</ul>
				I sort my list of primitives from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> in non-decreasing order w.r.t to the dimension \(d\). I then recursively generate my left and right children of my node (the left side contains all primitives whose \(d\)-th dimension is \(\lt m\), and the right side contains all primitives whose \(d\)-th dimension is \(\geq m\)). Then, I update the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> iterators on my current node to correspond to the new starting and ending pointers of my sorted sublist of primitives. This entire process provides me with a BVH that has a small depth and contains only a few primitives at each leaf node. I also had to deal with the edge case where there is no way to split the primitives from <code>start</code> to <code>end</code> due to all the centroids being the same, in which case I just turn my node into a leaf node (regardless of if I have reached the max leaf size yet).

			</li>

			<li>Here are some complex images generated with my BVH:

				<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
					<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					  <tr>

				</div>

			</li>

			<li>Below is a table of rendering times of moderately complex geometries with and without using my BVH.

			</li>
			I rendered using the command <code>./pathtracer -r 800 600 -t 8 -f OUTPUT_FILE ../dae/DAE_FILE</code> on a machine with the following (relevant) specs:
			<ul>
				<li>CPU: Ryzen 7 7800x3D (8-core, 16-thread)</li>
				<li>RAM: 32 GB 6400 MHz GDDR5</li>
			</ul>

			I observed a massive improvement in the runtime of every single one of these geometries. It appears that the more complex the mesh structure of the model, the worse the non-BVH algorithm performs in rendering (as there are more triangles to test, and every ray will, in the worst-case, test every triangle). As for the BVH solution, it performs the worse (relative to its own performance on other geometries) if the mesh takes-up a lot of the camera view (as we will have to perform many inevitable triangle intersections to both see if we intersect a triangle with our ray, and find the earliest intersection points). But, since the BVH allows us to test collisions with bounding boxes before checking ray intersections with each primitive, we end-up getting a rather great speed-up (as we can often just avoid testing the vast majority of triangles for intersections). From a more theoretical perspective, if I want to intersect \(m\) rays with \(n\) triangles in my mesh, without a BVH, I will end-up taking \(\mathcal{O}(mn)\) time. This is because I will have to perform the triangle intersection test on every triangle in my scene for each ray. But, with my BVH (whose construction ensures an average height of around \(\mathcal{O}(\log n)\)), I will end-up only performing around \(\mathcal{O}(m\log n)\) intersection tests (assuming that my max leaf size is a rather small constant)! Additionally, a lot of these tests will end-up being cube intersection tests (where I use the slab technique specified in lecture), which are much more efficient/fast than the triangle intersection tests. Another nice property of my construction is that it picks the largest extent of the bounding-box to be the axis by which we split by the median at each node (this makes the intersection between our left and right-children bounding boxes of a node mostly small). Additionally, a potential reason that my non-BVH solution is not very fast is that I did not take many steps to optimize the triangle intersection algorithm (I utilized the built-in CGL matrix inversion function to implement Möller-Trumbore intersection).

		<h2>Part 3: Direct Illumination</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>

				For the direct hemisphere lighting, I have the following method of sampling:
				<ul>
					<li>We take a number of samples equal to the number of lights times the number of samples per light (specified by the <code>-l</code> flag).</li>

					<li>For each sample, we pick a random vector \(\vec{\omega_i}\) in a hemisphere around the intersection point of our ray with our primitive (we will call this point \(\vec{p}\)). We do this by picking a random point on the unit hemisphere, and then transform it to the space of our scene as follows: \(\vec{\omega_i}:=M_\text{O2W}\vec{\omega_i}\). Then, we use the function <code>intersect</code> with the a ray \(R_i\) centered at \(\vec{p}\) and in the direction of \(\vec{\omega_i}\), where the minimum \(t\)-value of the ray is at our \(\epsilon\) (to avoid intersection with the primitive that point \(\vec{p}\) is on). We assume that the radiance emitted by the surface that \(R_i\) intersects first is \(L_i\) and the sample represents the radiance coming-in from \(\vec{\omega_i}\) in the direction from \(\vec{p}\) to our camera \(\vec{\omega}_o\). Now, we get the following for the sample of our radiance:\[S_i=f(\vec{\omega_i}\rightarrow\vec{\omega_o}) L_i\cos\theta_i\]where \(\theta_i=\vec{\omega_i}^\top\vec{n}\) (this is because our vectors are unit vectors and \(\vec{n}\) is the normal to our intersection point on our primitive).</li>

					<li>Finally, we sum-up our \(S_i\) values and divide by the number of samples to get our final estimated radiance coming into the camera.</li>

				</ul>
				For the direct importance lighting, we have the following method of sampling:
				<ul>

					<li>We will sample separately for each light \(l\), and we will take the same number of samples for each light (specified by the <code>-l</code> flag). If the light emitter is a point mass, then we just take \(1\) sample.</li>
					
					<li>For each sample for each light, we will use the <code>sample_L</code> method on the light to get a random vector \(\vec{\omega_i}\) that points from \(\vec{p}\) to our light, the PDF \(p(\vec{\omega_i})\) of the sampling distribution, and the distance \(d_i\) from the sampled point on the light to our point \(p\).</li>
					
					<li>We then generate a ray \(R_i\) that is centered at \(p\) and goes in the direction of \(\vec{\omega_i}\) (just like in hemisphere lighting). This ray will have a minimum time of \(\epsilon\) to intersect (for the same reason as hemisphere lighting), but we will set the maximum time to \(d_i-\epsilon\) (as this ray is only to test if the path from \(\vec{p}\) to the light is obstructed or not). But this time, we will use the function <code>has_intersection</code> in our bounding-box to check if there is any primitive on the path between \(\vec{p}\) and the light (because we don't care about the properties of the primitive that was intersected or what specific time \(t\) that our ray intersects the obstruction). Assuming that the radiance emitted by the light is \(L_i\), we have the following sampled radiance:\[S_i=\frac{f(\vec{\omega_i}\rightarrow\vec{\omega_o}) L_i\cos\theta_i}{p\left(\vec{\omega_i}\right)}\]where \(\theta_i=\vec{\omega_i}^\top\vec{n}\).</li>
					
					<li>Then for each light, we average all the samples.</li>
					
					<li>We add-up these averages among all lights to get our final radiance.</li>
				
				</ul>

			</li>
			<li>

				Here are some images rendered with both lighting techniques (command: <code>./pathtracer -t 8 -s 64 -l 32 -m 6 [-H OR NOTHING] -f OUTPUT_FILE -r 480 480 ../dae/DAE_FILE</code>):

				Our shadows are much more aliased/grainy on a lower number of samples per light, but we get much better clarity as we exponentially increase the number of samples. But, the highest improvments in aliasing for soft shadows appears at the initial increases in the number of samples per light, and we get somewhat of a "diminishing returns" as we increase <code>l</code> more and more. As we increase the number of samples per light, we also get a smoother transition from the dark parts of soft shadows to the ligher parts.

			</li>

			<li>

				Firstly, uniform hemisphere sampling creates much grainier/aliased images than importance sampling. This is due to the fact that there is a lot of randomness in whether our randomly-generated ray hits a light source from the point that our camera ray intersects a primitive. A lot of this "chance" is avoided in importance sampling, as we can force every ray that we look at to be one that is already in the direction of a light, and the only "luck" is whether there is an obstruction between our light ray and some other primitive in the scene. Additionally, uniform hemisphere sampling generally has a darker appearance. This is due, once again, to the lower probability of picking a random ray and hitting a light with the ray (this is more pronounced in models with very few light sources). But, again, the importance sampling avoids the luck of picking a ray that is directed towards a light source and not just some other surface. Finally, in the way that I implemented importance sampling, importance sampling actually runs much faster than the standard hemisphere sampling. This is because in hemisphere shading, we have to both detect an intersection and record the primitive of the first intersection in our BVH (this is so we know what object our bouncing ray hit). This requires us to traverse a large amount of the BVH using the <code>intersect</code> method, and we don't have many opportunities to short-circuit our traversal. But, in importance sampling, we only need the BVH to see if some object obstructs the path from our bouncing point to the light. So, we can just use the standard <code>has_intersection</code> method, which will just short-circuit when a collision is found (as we don't care about getting the first collision, just a collision within our specified \(t\)-range for our ray).
